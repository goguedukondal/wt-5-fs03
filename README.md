I have used react hooks like useState() for maintaining states and I have also used useEffect() for handling side Effects like axios etc..
I have used axios which is third party Library for fetching data from api endpoint . axios is side Effect so i have used it inside useEffect() hook.
For CSS designing i have installed Chakra UI which is third party Library from i Have used Table which contains lot of components.
